## Hello Survivors

After the initial pre-alpha playtest, DayZ Battle Royale was delayed until a framework for DayZ Standalone was built that handled all of the very difficult tasks that would have taken a very long time to build ourselves.  Thankfully, [DayZ Expansion](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2116151222) has finally released! This solves so many issues that it really isn't worth describing in detail. What it does mean is that DayZ BR is back under development.
